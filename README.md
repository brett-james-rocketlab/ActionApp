# ActionApp
This is a placeholder ReactNative (bare) app, to be used with Github Actions

You can run this, and it because it's public it won't use minutes, and be negigble :) It's a good testing ground!

Goal: To have a few options for incrementing the version in a way that makes putting it on the various stores easier.

# To triger the github action.

Either create a new release on the right, or go to the actions tab on the top: 
https://github.com/brett-james-rocketlab/ActionApp/actions/workflows/android_build.yml , and Click on Run Workflow.
